# Basic REST API WITH CRUD OPERATION Task-1
Create an API with endpoints to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a users resource.Each user should have fields: id (UUID), name, email, and age.  Use an in-memory data structure (like an hashmap) for storage.  Ensure proper status codes and error handling (e.g., 404 for not found, 400 for bad requests).  Include basic input validation (e.g., checking if email is valid).

THE OPERATION THAT ARE PERFORMED IN:
CRUD means:
Create user
Read user(s)
Update user
Delete user

IT USES TECHNOLOGY LIKE:
FastAPI → API framework
Pydantic → validation
UUID → unique user IDs
In-memory dictionary → acts like a database
Swagger UI → API testing interface
