# PRODIGY_BWD_10-Task-1
Create an API with endpoints to perform
basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
operations on a users resource.Each user should have fields: id (UUID), name, email, and age.  Use an in-memory data structure (like an hashmap) for storage.  Ensure proper status codes and error handling (e.g., 404 for not found, 400 for bad requests).  Include basic input validation (e.g., checking if email is valid).
